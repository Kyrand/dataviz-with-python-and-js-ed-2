It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manhattan_Project\" title=\"Manhattan Project\">Manhattan Project<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metallurgical_Laboratory\" title=\"Metallurgical Laboratory\">Metallurgical Laboratory<\/a>, and served as Chancellor of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washington_University_in_St._Louis\" title=\"Washington University in St. Louis\">Washington University in St. Louis<\/a> from 1945 to 1953.<\/p><p>In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_National_Research_Council\" title=\"United States National Research Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\">National Research Council<\/a> Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cambridge_University\" title=\"Cambridge University\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Cambridge University<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cavendish_Laboratory\" title=\"Cavendish Laboratory\">Cavendish Laboratory<\/a> in England, where he studied the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scattering\" title=\"Scattering\">scattering<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)\" title=\"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)\">absorption<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gamma_rays\" title=\"Gamma rays\" class=\"mw-redirect\">gamma rays<\/a>. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ferromagnetism\" title=\"Ferromagnetism\">ferromagnetism<\/a>, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electron_spin\" title=\"Electron spin\" class=\"mw-redirect\">electron spins<\/a>, and studied <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosmic_ray\" title=\"Cosmic ray\">cosmic rays<\/a>, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.<\/p><p>During <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a>, Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_weapon\" title=\"Nuclear weapon\">nuclear weapons<\/a>. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_reactor\" title=\"Nuclear reactor\">nuclear reactors<\/a> to convert <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uranium\" title=\"Uranium\">uranium<\/a> into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enrico_Fermi\" title=\"Enrico Fermi\">Enrico Fermi<\/a>'s creation of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicago_Pile-1\" title=\"Chicago Pile-1\">Chicago Pile-1<\/a>, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-10_Graphite_Reactor\" title=\"X-10 Graphite Reactor\">X-10 Graphite Reactor<\/a> at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee\" title=\"Oak Ridge, Tennessee\">Oak Ridge, Tennessee<\/a>. Plutonium began being produced in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hanford_Site\" title=\"Hanford Site\">Hanford Site<\/a> reactors in 1945.<\/p><p>After the war, Compton became Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. During his tenure, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions, named its first female full professor, and enrolled a record number of students after wartime veterans returned to the United States.<\/p>","name":"Arthur H.
