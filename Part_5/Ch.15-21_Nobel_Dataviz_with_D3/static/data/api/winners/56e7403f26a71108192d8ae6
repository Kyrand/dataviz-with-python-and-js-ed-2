He then showed that giving animals the drug <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reserpine\" title=\"Reserpine\">reserpine<\/a> caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control. These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. By administering to these animals <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L-Dopa\" title=\"L-Dopa\" class=\"mw-redirect\">L-Dopa<\/a>, which is the precursor of dopamine, he could alleviate the symptoms. These findings led other doctors to try using L-Dopa on patients with Parkinson's disease, and found it to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of the disease.
