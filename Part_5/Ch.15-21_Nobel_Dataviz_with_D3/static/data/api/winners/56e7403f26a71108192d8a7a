In 1902 he was given a readership in biochemistry, and in 1910 he became a Fellow of Trinity College, and an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College. In 1914 he was elected to the Chair of Biochemistry at Cambridge University, thus becoming the first Professor in that discipline at Cambridge.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Hopkins#cite_note-3\"><span>[<\/span>3<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup> His Cambridge students included neurochemistry pioneer <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Judah_Hirsch_Quastel\" title=\"Judah Hirsch Quastel\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Judah Hirsch Quastel<\/a> and pioneer <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embryologist\" title=\"Embryologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\">embryologist<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseph_Needham\" title=\"Joseph Needham\">Joseph Needham<\/a>.<\/p><p>Hopkins had for a long time studied how cells obtain energy via a complex metabolic process of oxidation and reduction reactions. His study in 1907 with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sir_Walter_Morley_Fletcher\" title=\"Sir Walter Morley Fletcher\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Sir Walter Morley Fletcher<\/a> of the connection between lactic acid and muscle contraction was one of the central achievements of his work on the biochemistry of the cell. He and Fletcher showed that oxygen depletion causes an accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle. Their work paved the way for the later discovery by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Archibald_Hill\" title=\"Archibald Hill\">Archibald Hill<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Otto_Fritz_Meyerhof\" title=\"Otto Fritz Meyerhof\">Otto Fritz Meyerhof<\/a> that a carbohydrate metabolic cycle supplies the energy used for muscle contraction.<\/p><p>In 1912 Hopkins published the work for which he is best known, demonstrating in a series of animal feeding experiments that diets consisting of pure proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and water fail to support animal growth. This led him to suggest the existence in normal diets of tiny quantities of as yet unidentified substances that are essential for animal growth and survival. These hypothetical substances he called \u201caccessory food factors\u201d, later renamed vitamins.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Hopkins#cite_note-4\"><span>[<\/span>4<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup> It was this work that led his being awarded (together with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christiaan_Eijkman\" title=\"Christiaan Eijkman\">Christiaan Eijkman<\/a>) the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physiology for Medicine.<\/p><p>During <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I<\/a>, Hopkins continued his work on the nutritional value of vitamins. His efforts were especially valuable in a time of food shortages and rationing.

As a result of his work, vitamin-enriched margarine was introduced in 1926.<\/p><p>Hopkins is credited with the discovery and characterization in 1921 of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glutathione\" title=\"Glutathione\">glutathione<\/a> extracted from various animal tissues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Hopkins#cite_note-5\"><span>[<\/span>5<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup> At the time he proposed that the compound was a dipeptide of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glutamic_acid\" title=\"Glutamic acid\">glutamic acid<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cysteine\" title=\"Cysteine\">cysteine<\/a>.
