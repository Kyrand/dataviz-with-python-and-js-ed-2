He played a significant role in the development of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_weapon\" title=\"Nuclear weapon\">atom bomb<\/a>, but may be most prominent for his contribution to theories on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment\" title=\"Miller\u2013Urey experiment\">development of organic life from non-living matter<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harold_C._Urey#cite_note-1\"><span>[<\/span>1<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>Born in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Walkerton,_Indiana\" title=\"Walkerton, Indiana\">Walkerton, Indiana<\/a>, Urey studied <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thermodynamics\" title=\"Thermodynamics\">thermodynamics<\/a> under <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gilbert_N._Lewis\" title=\"Gilbert N.

After he received his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PhD\" title=\"PhD\" class=\"mw-redirect\">PhD<\/a> in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_American-Scandinavian_Foundation\" title=\"The American-Scandinavian Foundation\">the American-Scandinavian Foundation<\/a> to study at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niels_Bohr_Institute\" title=\"Niels Bohr Institute\">Niels Bohr Institute<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen<\/a>.

In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.<\/p><p>During World War II Urey turned his knowledge of isotope separation to the problem of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uranium_enrichment\" title=\"Uranium enrichment\" class=\"mw-redirect\">uranium enrichment<\/a>. He headed the group located at Columbia University that developed isotope separation using <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gaseous_diffusion\" title=\"Gaseous diffusion\">gaseous diffusion<\/a>. The method was successfully developed, becoming the sole method used in the early post-war period.
