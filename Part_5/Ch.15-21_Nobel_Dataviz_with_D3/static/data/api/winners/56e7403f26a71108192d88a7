Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Complementarity_(physics)\" title=\"Complementarity (physics)\">complementarity<\/a>: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality\" title=\"Wave\u2013particle duality\">wave or a stream of particles<\/a>. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.<\/p><p>Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Copenhagen\" title=\"University of Copenhagen\">University of Copenhagen<\/a>, now known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niels_Bohr_Institute\" title=\"Niels Bohr Institute\">Niels Bohr Institute<\/a>, which opened in 1920.

Later, the element <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bohrium\" title=\"Bohrium\">bohrium<\/a> was named after him.<\/p><p>During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nazism\" title=\"Nazism\">Nazism<\/a>. After <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Invasion_of_Denmark\" title=\"Invasion of Denmark\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Denmark was occupied by the Germans<\/a>, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/German_nuclear_energy_project\" title=\"German nuclear energy project\" class=\"mw-redirect\">German nuclear energy project<\/a>. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden.
