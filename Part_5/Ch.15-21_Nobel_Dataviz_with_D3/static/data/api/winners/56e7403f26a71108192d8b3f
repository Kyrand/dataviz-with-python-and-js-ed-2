He was widely regarded as one of the very few physicists to excel both <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theoretical_physicist\" title=\"Theoretical physicist\" class=\"mw-redirect\">theoretically<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Experimental_physicist\" title=\"Experimental physicist\" class=\"mw-redirect\">experimentally<\/a>.<\/p><p>Fermi's first major contribution was to statistical mechanics. After <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wolfgang_Pauli\" title=\"Wolfgang Pauli\">Wolfgang Pauli<\/a> announced his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pauli_exclusion_principle\" title=\"Pauli exclusion principle\">exclusion principle<\/a> in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ideal_gas\" title=\"Ideal gas\">ideal gas<\/a>, employing a statistical formulation now known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics\" title=\"Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics\">Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics<\/a>. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermion\" title=\"Fermion\">fermions<\/a>\". Later Pauli postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beta_decay\" title=\"Beta decay\">beta decay<\/a>, to satisfy the law of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conservation_of_energy\" title=\"Conservation of energy\">conservation of energy<\/a>. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neutrino\" title=\"Neutrino\">neutrino<\/a>\". His theory, later referred to as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermi%27s_interaction\" title=\"Fermi's interaction\">Fermi's interaction<\/a> and still later as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weak_interaction\" title=\"Weak interaction\">weak interaction<\/a>, described one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fundamental_interaction\" title=\"Fundamental interaction\">four fundamental forces of nature<\/a>. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neutron\" title=\"Neutron\">neutrons<\/a>, Fermi discovered that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slow_neutron\" title=\"Slow neutron\" class=\"mw-redirect\">slow neutrons<\/a> were more easily <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neutron_capture\" title=\"Neutron capture\">captured<\/a> than fast ones, and developed the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermi_age_equation\" title=\"Fermi age equation\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Fermi age equation<\/a> to describe this. After bombarding <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thorium\" title=\"Thorium\">thorium<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uranium\" title=\"Uranium\">uranium<\/a> with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements; although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were subsequently revealed to be <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fission_products\" title=\"Fission products\" class=\"mw-redirect\">fission products<\/a>.<\/p><p>Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Italian_Racial_Laws\" title=\"Italian Racial Laws\">Italian Racial Laws<\/a> that affected his Jewish wife Laura. He emigrated to the United States where he worked on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manhattan_Project\" title=\"Manhattan Project\">Manhattan Project<\/a> during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_reactor_physics#Criticality\" title=\"Nuclear reactor physics\">critical<\/a> on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first artificial self-sustaining <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_chain_reaction\" title=\"Nuclear chain reaction\">nuclear chain reaction<\/a>. He was on hand when the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-10_Graphite_Reactor\" title=\"X-10 Graphite Reactor\">X-10 Graphite Reactor<\/a> at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee\" title=\"Oak Ridge, Tennessee\">Oak Ridge, Tennessee<\/a> went critical in 1943, and when the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/B_Reactor\" title=\"B Reactor\">B Reactor<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hanford_Site\" title=\"Hanford Site\">Hanford Site<\/a> did so the next year. At <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory\" title=\"Los Alamos National Laboratory\">Los Alamos<\/a> he headed F Division, part of which worked on <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edward_Teller\" title=\"Edward Teller\">Edward Teller<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thermonuclear\" title=\"Thermonuclear\" class=\"mw-redirect\">thermonuclear<\/a> \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Teller%E2%80%93Ulam_design\" title=\"History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design\">Super<\/a>\" bomb. He was present at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_test\" title=\"Trinity test\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Trinity test<\/a> on 16 July 1945, where he used his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermi_method\" title=\"Fermi method\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Fermi method<\/a> to estimate the bomb's yield.<\/p><p>After the war, Fermi served under <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J._Robert_Oppenheimer\" title=\"J. Robert Oppenheimer\">J. Robert Oppenheimer<\/a> on the influential General Advisory Committee, which advised the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission\" title=\"United States Atomic Energy Commission\">Atomic Energy Commission<\/a> on nuclear matters and policy. Following the detonation of the first Soviet <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fission_bomb\" title=\"Fission bomb\" class=\"mw-redirect\">fission bomb<\/a> in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oppenheimer_security_hearing\" title=\"Oppenheimer security hearing\">hearing<\/a> that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pion\" title=\"Pion\">pions<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muon\" title=\"Muon\">muons<\/a>, and he speculated that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosmic_rays\" title=\"Cosmic rays\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cosmic rays<\/a> arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space.
