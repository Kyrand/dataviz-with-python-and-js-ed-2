        This chart shows the large discrepancy between total male and female
        Nobel prize-winners by prize category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all categories are equally unequal, with Economics being almost
        totally a male affair while Literature and Peace are considerably
        closer. Within the sciences females fair better in Physiology or
        Medicine than in Physics or Chemistry.
