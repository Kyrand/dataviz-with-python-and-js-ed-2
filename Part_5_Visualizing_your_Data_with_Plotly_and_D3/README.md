# Visualizing your Data with Plotly and D3

In the first chapter of this part we see how to take the fruits of your Pandas driven
exploration, in the form of charts or maps, and put them on the web, where they
belong. Matplotlib can produce publication standard static charts while Plotly brings
user controls and dynamic charts to the table. We see how to take a Plotly chart
directly from a Jupyter notebook and put it in a web-page.

I think it’s fair to say that taking on D3 was the most ambitious part of this book, but I
was determined to demonstrate the construction of a multi-element visualization,
such as the kind you may well end up being employed to make. One of the joys of D3
is the huge number of examples that can easily be found online, but most of them
demonstrate a single technique and there are few showing how to orchestrate multi‐
ple visual elements. In these D3 chapters, we see how to synchronize the update of a
timeline (featuring all the Nobel Prizes), a map, a bar chart, and a list as the user fil‐
tered the Nobel Prize dataset or changed the prize-winning metric (absolute or per
capita).

Mastery of the core themes demonstrated in these chapters should allow you to let
loose your imagination and learn by doing. I’d recommend choosing some data close
to your heart and designing a D3 creation around it.
