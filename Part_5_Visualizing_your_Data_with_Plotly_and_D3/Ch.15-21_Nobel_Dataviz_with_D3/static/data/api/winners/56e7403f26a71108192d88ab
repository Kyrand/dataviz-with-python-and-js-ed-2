Mottelson worked with Aage Bohr to compare the theoretical models with experimental data. In three papers which were published in 1952\u201353, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum. This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies.<\/p><p>Rainwater, Bohr and Mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nobelpressrelease_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ben_Roy_Mottelson#cite_note-Nobelpressrelease-2\"><span>[<\/span>2<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monograph\" title=\"Monograph\">monograph<\/a>, <i>Nuclear Structure<\/i>.
