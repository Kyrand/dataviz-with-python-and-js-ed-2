Using Geiger's recently developed <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geiger_counter\" title=\"Geiger counter\">Geiger counter<\/a>, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beta_decay#Beta_emission_spectrum\" title=\"Beta decay\">continuous spectrum<\/a>, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when the First World War broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruhleben_internment_camp\" title=\"Ruhleben internment camp\">Ruhleben internment camp<\/a>.<\/p><p>After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cavendish_Laboratory\" title=\"Cavendish Laboratory\">Cavendish Laboratory<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Cambridge\" title=\"University of Cambridge\">University of Cambridge<\/a>, where Chadwick earned his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctor_of_Philosophy\" title=\"Doctor of Philosophy\">Doctor of Philosophy<\/a> degree under Rutherford's supervision from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge\">Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge<\/a> in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Cockcroft\" title=\"John Cockcroft\">John Cockcroft<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Norman_Feather\" title=\"Norman Feather\">Norman Feather<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mark_Oliphant\" title=\"Mark Oliphant\">Mark Oliphant<\/a>. Chadwick pursued a line of research that led to his discovery of the neutron in 1932, and went on to measure its <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass\" title=\"Mass\">mass<\/a>. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Liverpool\" title=\"University of Liverpool\">University of Liverpool<\/a>, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclotron\" title=\"Cyclotron\">cyclotron<\/a>, made it an important centre for the study of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_physics\" title=\"Nuclear physics\">nuclear physics<\/a>.<\/p><p>During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tube_Alloys\" title=\"Tube Alloys\">Tube Alloys<\/a> project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Luftwaffe\" title=\"Luftwaffe\">Luftwaffe<\/a> bombing. When the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quebec_Agreement\" title=\"Quebec Agreement\">Quebec Agreement<\/a> merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Alamos_Laboratory\" title=\"Los Alamos Laboratory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Los Alamos Laboratory<\/a> and in Washington, D.C.
