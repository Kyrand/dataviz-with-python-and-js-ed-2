Since then, he has been doing research on the growth, characterization and device applications of group III nitride semiconductors, which are well known as materials used in blue light-emitting diodes. In 1985, he developed low-temperature deposited buffer layers for the growth of group III nitride semiconductor films on a sapphire substrate, which led to the realization of group-III-nitride semiconductor based light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. In 1989, he succeeded in growing p-type GaN and fabricating a p-n-junction-type GaN-based UV\/blue light-emitting diode for the first time in the world.<\/p>","name":"Hiroshi Amano","place_of_birth":null,"place_of_death":null,"text":"Hiroshi Amano , Physics, 2014","year":2014.0}
