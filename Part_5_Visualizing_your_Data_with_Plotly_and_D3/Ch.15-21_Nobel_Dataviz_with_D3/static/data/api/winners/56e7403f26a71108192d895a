As Secretary of War under McKinley and Roosevelt, Root designed American policies for the new colonial possessions, especially the Philippines and Cuba. His role in suppressing a Filipino revolt angered anti-imperialist activists at home. Root favored a paternalistic approach to colonial administration, emphasizing technology, engineering, and disinterested public service, as exemplified by the ethical standards of the Progressive Era. Like most American progressives, he had his doubts about democracy, both in the United States and in the Philippines. He helped design the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Foraker_Act\" title=\"Foraker Act\">Foraker Act<\/a> of 1900, the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Philippine_Organic_Act_(1902)\" title=\"Philippine Organic Act (1902)\">Philippine Organic Act (1902)<\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Platt_Amendment\" title=\"Platt Amendment\">Platt Amendment<\/a> of 1901, which authorized American intervention in Cuba in the future if needed to maintain a stable government.

He restructured the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Guard_of_the_United_States\" title=\"National Guard of the United States\">National Guard<\/a> into an effective reserve, and created the Army War College for the advanced study of military doctrine and most important set up a general staff. As Secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt, Root modernized the consular service by minimizing patronage, promoted friendly relations with Latin America, and resolved frictions with Japan over the immigration of unskilled workers to the West Coast.

He played a central role at the Republican National Convention in 1912 in getting Taft renominated. By 1916\u201317, he was a leading proponent of preparedness, with the expectation the United States would enter World War I. President Woodrow Wilson sent him to Russia in 1917, in a mission that accomplished nothing. Root supported Wilson's vision of the League of Nations, but with reservations along the lines proposed by Republican Senator <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henry_Cabot_Lodge\" title=\"Henry Cabot Lodge\">Henry Cabot Lodge<\/a>. He was a strong advocate of using international law to prevent war, and helped design the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice\" title=\"Permanent Court of International Justice\">Permanent Court of International Justice<\/a> (World Court).<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elihu_Root#cite_note-2\"><span>[<\/span>2<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup><\/p>","name":"Elihu Root","place_of_birth":"Clinton, New York ,  U.S.","place_of_death":"New York, New York ,  U.S.","text":"Elihu Root , Peace, 1912","year":1912.0}
