The Nobel academy said Ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces. His findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development, the academy said. \u201cSurface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer, as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere,\u201d the award citation reads.<\/p>","name":"Gerhard Ertl","place_of_birth":"Bad Cannstatt ,  Germany","place_of_death":null,"text":"Gerhard Ertl , Chemistry, 2007","year":2007.0}
