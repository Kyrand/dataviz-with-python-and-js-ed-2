His father was a captain in the Royal Bavarian Regiment, who was soon transferred to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Munich\" title=\"Munich\">Munich<\/a>. During his childhood, he spent most of his time with his grandmother at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wasserburg_am_Inn\" title=\"Wasserburg am Inn\">Wasserburg am Inn<\/a>. He went to the Royal Junior High School in Augsburg (predecessor of Holbein Gymnasium ), also in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/W%C3%BCrzburg\" title=\"W\u00fcrzburg\">W\u00fcrzburg<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulm\" title=\"Ulm\">Ulm<\/a>. After serving as a one-year volunteer in the Bavarian first Field Artillery Regiment, he took interest in the color theory and began studying art at the Munich Academy of Painting (1891-1893). He was taught under Schmid-Reutte and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Franz_von_Lenbach\" title=\"Franz von Lenbach\">Lenbach<\/a>, a German painter of realist style. He therefore went to attend the University of Berlin to study chemistry under <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hermann_Emil_Fischer\" title=\"Hermann Emil Fischer\">Emil Fischer<\/a> and A. Rosenheim, and physics under <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emil_Warburg\" title=\"Emil Warburg\">E. Warburg<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Max_Planck\" title=\"Max Planck\">Max Planck<\/a>; where in 1895 he received his doctorate.<\/p><p>In 1899, Euler-Chelpin was appointed to teach <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Privatdozent\" title=\"Privatdozent\">Privatdozent<\/a> in the Royal University at Stockholm where he began visiting the laboratory of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jacobus_Henricus_van_%27t_Hoff\" title=\"Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff\">van 't Hoff<\/a>, one of the many who influenced Euler-Chelpin's interest in science along with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Walther_Nernst\" title=\"Walther Nernst\">Nernst<\/a>.<\/p><p>In 1902, he took out Swedish citizenship. Nevertheless, during the First World War, Euler Chelpin took part in voluntary service in the German Air Force. [3] [4] During the Second World War, the professor worked in a diplomatic mission on the German side.<\/p><p>In 1906, he was appointed Professor of General and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Organic_chemistry\" title=\"Organic chemistry\">Organic Chemistry<\/a> in the Royal University, Stockholm. In 1929, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the International Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation established in Stockholm the Vitamin Institute and Institute of Biochemistry, and Von Euler-Chelpin was appointed as its director. In 1941 he retired from teaching, but continued his researches.<\/p><p>Hans Von Euler-Chelpin married twice. His first wife was <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Astrid_Cleve\" title=\"Astrid Cleve\">Astrid Cleve<\/a>, who was the first Swedish women to obtain a doctoral degree of science. In 1913, he married again to his second wife, Elisabeth Baroness af Ugglas (1887-1973), whose participated in collaborations with Euler-Chelpin. His son, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulf_von_Euler\" title=\"Ulf von Euler\">Ulf von Euler<\/a> (1905 - 1983), was a well-known physiologist and in 1970 he received a Nobel Prize for his research on the chemical nature of nor epinephrine on the synapses. In 1931, his daughter Karin von Euler Chelpin married the writer <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sven_Stolpe\" title=\"Sven Stolpe\">Sven Stolpe<\/a>.<\/p><p>During his life, Euler-Chelpin created a series of monographs such as <i>Biochemistry of Tumours<\/i>, written in collaboration with Boleslaw Skarzynski, published in 1942 and the other entitled <i>The Chemotherapy and Prophylaxis of Cancer<\/i>, published in 1962.<\/p><p>At the age of 91, Euler-Chelpin died in Stockholm on November 6, 1964.<\/p><p>In 1929, Euler Chelpin and Arthur Harden received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for research on alcoholic fermentation of carbohydrates and the role of enzymes. Arthur Harden dealt only with the chemical effects of bacteria from 1903 with alcoholic fermentation. Harden discovered that the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enzyme\" title=\"Enzyme\">enzyme<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zymase\" title=\"Zymase\">zymase<\/a>, discovered by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eduard_Buchner\" title=\"Eduard Buchner\">Eduard Buchner<\/a>, only produces fermentation in interaction with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coenzyme\" title=\"Coenzyme\" class=\"mw-redirect\">coenzyme<\/a> cozymase. Euler Chelpin, in turn, convincingly described what happens in sugar fermentation and the action of fermentation enzymes using physical chemistry. This explanation led to the understanding of the important processes taking place in the muscles for the supply of energy.<\/p>","name":"Hans von Euler-Chelpin","place_of_birth":"Augsburg ,  Kingdom of Bavaria","place_of_death":"Stockholm ,  Sweden","text":"Hans von Euler-Chelpin ,  born in Germany , Chemistry, 1929","year":1929.0}
