Since the 1920s it had been suspected that the Sun shines because of nuclear fusion reactions that transform hydrogen into helium and release energy. Later, theoretical calculations indicated that countless neutrinos must be released in these reactions and, consequently, that Earth must be exposed to a constant flood of solar neutrinos. Because neutrinos interact weakly with matter, however, only one in a trillion is stopped on its way to Earth. Neutrinos thus developed a reputation as being undetectable.<\/p><p>In the 1980s, Koshiba, drawing on the work done by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Raymond_Davis_Jr.\" title=\"Raymond Davis Jr.\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Raymond Davis Jr<\/a>, constructed an underground neutrino detector in a zinc mine in Japan. Called Kamiokande II, it was an enormous water tank surrounded by electronic detectors to sense flashes of light produced when neutrinos interacted with atomic nuclei in water molecules. Koshiba was able to confirm Davis's results\u2014that the Sun produces neutrinos and that fewer neutrinos were found than had been expected (a deficit that became known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solar_neutrino_problem\" title=\"Solar neutrino problem\">solar neutrino problem<\/a>). In 1987 Kamiokande also detected neutrinos from a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supernova\" title=\"Supernova\">supernova<\/a> explosion outside the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Milky_Way\" title=\"Milky Way\">Milky Way<\/a>. After building a larger, more sensitive detector named <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super-Kamiokande\" title=\"Super-Kamiokande\">Super-Kamiokande<\/a>, which became operational in 1996, Koshiba found strong evidence for what scientists had already suspected\u2014that neutrinos, of which three types are known, change from one type into another in flight; this resolves the solar neutrino problem, since early experiments could only detect one type, not all three.<\/p><p>In 2003, he was awarded the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Franklin_Institute_Awards\" title=\"The Franklin Institute Awards\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Benjamin Franklin Medal<\/a> in Physics.<\/p><p>Koshiba is a member of the Board of Sponsors of The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bulletin_of_the_Atomic_Scientists\" title=\"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists<\/a>.<\/p><p>He is a foreign fellow of <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Academy_of_Sciences&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Bangladesh Academy of Sciences (page does not exist)\">Bangladesh Academy of Sciences<\/a> <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Masatoshi_Koshiba#cite_note-2\"><span>[<\/span>2<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>In commemoration of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Prize\">Nobel Prize<\/a>-winning by Masatoshi Koshiba, <i>Koshiba<\/i> hall was established at the University of Tokyo.<sup id=\"cite_ref-.E5.AF.BA.E5.B4.8E.E6.98.8C.E7.94.B72007_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Masatoshi_Koshiba#cite_note-.E5.AF.BA.E5.B4.8E.E6.98.8C.E7.94.B72007-3\"><span>[<\/span>3<span>]<\/span><\/a><\/sup><\/p>","name":"Masatoshi Koshiba","place_of_birth":"Toyohashi ,  Aichi Prefecture ,  Japan","place_of_death":null,"text":"Masatoshi Koshiba , Physics, 2002","year":2002.0}
