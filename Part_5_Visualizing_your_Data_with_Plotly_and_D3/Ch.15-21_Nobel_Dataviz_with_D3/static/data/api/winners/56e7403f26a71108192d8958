As a leader of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party\" title=\"History of the United States Republican Party\">Republican Party<\/a> during this time, he became a driving force for the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Era\" title=\"Progressive Era\">Progressive Era<\/a> in the United States in the early 20th century.<\/p><p>Born a sickly child with debilitating <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asthma\" title=\"Asthma\">asthma<\/a>, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Masculinity\" title=\"Masculinity\">masculinity<\/a>. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harvard_College\" title=\"Harvard College\">Harvard College<\/a>. His first of many books, <i><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Naval_War_of_1812\" title=\"The Naval War of 1812\">The Naval War of 1812<\/a><\/i> (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_West\" title=\"American West\" class=\"mw-redirect\">American West<\/a> and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy\" title=\"Assistant Secretary of the Navy\">Assistant Secretary of the Navy<\/a> under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rough_Riders\" title=\"Rough Riders\">Rough Riders<\/a>, where he gained national fame for courage during the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War\" title=\"Spanish\u2013American War\">War in Cuba<\/a>. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious, but considered by them powerless, position of running for vice president as McKinley's running mate in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_presidential_election,_1900\" title=\"United States presidential election, 1900\">election of 1900<\/a>. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley win re-election by a landslide on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism.<\/p><p>Following the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_William_McKinley\" title=\"Assassination of William McKinley\">assassination of President McKinley<\/a> in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, became the youngest United States President in history.

Making conservation a top priority, he established myriad new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Park_Service\" title=\"National Park Service\">national parks, forests, and monuments<\/a> intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roosevelt_Corollary\" title=\"Roosevelt Corollary\">focused on Central America<\/a>, where he began construction of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panama_Canal\" title=\"Panama Canal\">Panama Canal<\/a>. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_White_Fleet\" title=\"Great White Fleet\">Great White Fleet<\/a> on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russo-Japanese_War\" title=\"Russo-Japanese War\">Russo-Japanese War<\/a> won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_presidential_election,_1904\" title=\"United States presidential election, 1904\">Elected in 1904<\/a> to a full term, he continued his pursuit of progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Howard_Taft\" title=\"William Howard Taft\">William Howard Taft<\/a>, to succeed him in the presidency, and after leaving office, went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor, trying but failing to win <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1912_Republican_National_Convention\" title=\"1912 Republican National Convention\">the presidential nomination<\/a> again himself in 1912. He then founded his own party, the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)\" title=\"Progressive Party (United States, 1912)\">Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party<\/a>, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split allowed the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_presidential_election,_1912\" title=\"United States presidential election, 1912\">1912<\/a>, and Republicans aligned with Taft would control the Republican Party for decades.<\/p><p>Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roosevelt%E2%80%93Rondon_Scientific_Expedition\" title=\"Roosevelt\u2013Rondon Scientific Expedition\">two-year expedition in the Amazon<\/a>, nearly dying of tropical disease. During <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I<\/a>, he opposed <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Woodrow_Wilson\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson\">President Wilson<\/a> for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although he planned to run again for president in 1920, his health quickly deteriorated, and he died in early 1919.
