Quidde's long career spanned four different eras of German history: that of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Otto_von_Bismarck\" title=\"Otto von Bismarck\">Bismarck<\/a> (up to 1890); the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/German_Empire\" title=\"German Empire\">Hohenzollern Empire<\/a> under Wilhelm II (1888\u20131918); the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weimar_Republic\" title=\"Weimar Republic\">Weimar Republic<\/a> (1918\u20131933); and, finally, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nazi_Germany\" title=\"Nazi Germany\">Nazi Germany<\/a>. In 1927, he was awarded the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobel_Peace_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Peace Prize\">Nobel Peace Prize<\/a>.<\/p><p>Born into a wealthy <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bourgeoisie\" title=\"Bourgeoisie\">bourgeois<\/a> merchant family, Quidde grew up in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bremen_(city)\" title=\"Bremen (city)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Bremen<\/a>, read history and also got involved in the activities of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/German_Peace_Society\" title=\"German Peace Society\">German Peace Society<\/a> (<i>Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft<\/i>). In his younger years he had already opposed Bismarck's policies. In 1881 he received his PhD at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen\" title=\"University of G\u00f6ttingen\">University of G\u00f6ttingen<\/a>. In 1894 Quidde published a 17-page <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pamphlet\" title=\"Pamphlet\">pamphlet<\/a> entitled <i>Caligula. Eine Studie \u00fcber r\u00f6mischen Caesarenwahnsinn<\/i> (<i>Caligula: A Study of Imperial Insanity<\/i>). Containing 79 footnotes, the short essay is exclusively about the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Roman Empire<\/a> of the 1st century AD. However, Quidde drew an implicit parallel between the Roman Emperor <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caligula\" title=\"Caligula\">Caligula<\/a> and Wilhelm II, de facto accusing both rulers of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Megalomania\" title=\"Megalomania\">megalomania<\/a>. The author had insisted on publishing his pamphlet under his real name, which effectively ended his academic career as a historian when, in some periodical, a short review explained the parallels which otherwise might have gone unnoticed. After he made a derogatory comment on a new medal in honour of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_I,_German_Emperor\" title=\"William I, German Emperor\">William the Great<\/a>, German Emperor from 1871 to 1888, he was criminally convicted of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9\" title=\"L\u00e8se majest\u00e9\" class=\"mw-redirect\">l\u00e8se majest\u00e9<\/a>, and sentenced to three months in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prison\" title=\"Prison\">prison<\/a>, which he served in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stadelheim_Prison\" title=\"Stadelheim Prison\">Stadelheim Prison<\/a>.<\/p><p>After the end of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">First World War<\/a>, Quidde, like most other Germans, vehemently opposed the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Treaty_of_Versailles\" title=\"Treaty of Versailles\">Treaty of Versailles<\/a> but for different reasons from German <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Militarism\" title=\"Militarism\">militarists<\/a>, who hated mainly the vast restrictions laid upon the German armed forces and the impending economic disaster that would be caused by payment of the high reparations that were decreed. He and other German pacifists thought ahead and hoped that US President <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Woodrow_Wilson\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson\">Woodrow Wilson<\/a> would win the day, pointing out that such severe conditions would already sow the seeds of a new war:<\/p><p>When <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adolf_Hitler\" title=\"Adolf Hitler\">Hitler<\/a> came to power in 1933, Quidde escaped to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Switzerland<\/a>, finally settling down in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geneva\" title=\"Geneva\">Geneva<\/a> for the rest of his days. He remained an optimist throughout his life. Aged 76, he published his essay \"Landfriede und Weltfriede\" (1934) at a time when <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Militarism\" title=\"Militarism\">militarism<\/a> was again on the rise, believing that modern technology might serve as a deterrent from war:<\/p><p>Ludwig Quidde died in his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Swiss<\/a> exile in 1941, aged 82.<\/p>","name":"Ludwig Quidde","place_of_birth":"Bremen","place_of_death":"Geneva","text":"Ludwig Quidde , Peace, 1927","year":1927.0}
