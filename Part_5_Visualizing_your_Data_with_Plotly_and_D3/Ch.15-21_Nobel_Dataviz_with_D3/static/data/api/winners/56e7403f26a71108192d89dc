Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K-meson\" title=\"K-meson\" class=\"mw-redirect\">K-mesons<\/a>, that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time.
