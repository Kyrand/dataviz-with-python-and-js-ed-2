Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.<\/p><p>With her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bernardo_Houssay\" title=\"Bernardo Houssay\">Bernardo Houssay<\/a>, Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glycogen\" title=\"Glycogen\">glycogen<\/a>\u2014a derivative of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glucose\" title=\"Glucose\">glucose<\/a>\u2014is broken down in muscle tissue into <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lactic_acid\" title=\"Lactic acid\">lactic acid<\/a> and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cori_cycle\" title=\"Cori cycle\">Cori cycle<\/a>).
