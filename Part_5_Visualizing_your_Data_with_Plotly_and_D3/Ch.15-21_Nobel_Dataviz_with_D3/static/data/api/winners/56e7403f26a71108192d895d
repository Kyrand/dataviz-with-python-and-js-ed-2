Millikan<\/b> (March 22, 1868 \u2013 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Physics\" title=\"Physics\">physicist<\/a> honored with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_for_Physics\" title=\"Nobel Prize for Physics\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Nobel Prize for Physics<\/a> in 1923 for his measurement of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elementary_charge\" title=\"Elementary charge\">elementary electronic charge<\/a> and for his work on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Photoelectric_effect\" title=\"Photoelectric effect\">photoelectric effect<\/a>.<\/p><p>Millikan graduated from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oberlin_College\" title=\"Oberlin College\">Oberlin College<\/a> in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University<\/a> in 1895. In 1896 he became an assistant at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago<\/a>, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electric_charge\" title=\"Electric charge\">electric charge<\/a> carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Water\" title=\"Water\">water<\/a> droplets in an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electric_field\" title=\"Electric field\">electric field<\/a>. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oil_drop_experiment\" title=\"Oil drop experiment\">oil-drop experiment<\/a> in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oil\" title=\"Oil\">oil<\/a>.<\/p><p>In 1916 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Albert_Einstein\" title=\"Albert Einstein\">Albert Einstein<\/a> in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planck%E2%80%99s_constant\" title=\"Planck\u2019s constant\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Planck\u2019s constant<\/a>. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/California_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"California Institute of Technology\">California Institute of Technology<\/a> (Caltech) in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pasadena,_California\" title=\"Pasadena, California\">Pasadena<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/California\" title=\"California\">California<\/a>. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victor_Hess\" title=\"Victor Hess\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Victor Hess<\/a> had detected coming from outer space. Millikan proved that this radiation is indeed of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Outer_space\" title=\"Outer space\">extraterrestrial<\/a> origin, and he named it \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosmic_rays\" title=\"Cosmic rays\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cosmic rays<\/a>.\u201d As chairman of the Executive Council of Caltech (the school's governing body at the time) from 1921 until his retirement in 1945, Millikan helped to turn the school into one of the leading research institutions in the United States. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Society_for_Science_%26_the_Public\" title=\"Society for Science &amp; the Public\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Society for Science &amp; the Public<\/a>, from 1921 to 1953.<\/p>","name":"Robert A.
