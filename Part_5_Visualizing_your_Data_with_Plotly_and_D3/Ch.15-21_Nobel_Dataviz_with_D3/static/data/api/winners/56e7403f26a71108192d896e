He is also known for his work on <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enriched_uranium#Enrichment_methods\" title=\"Enriched uranium\">uranium-isotope separation<\/a> for the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manhattan_Project\" title=\"Manhattan Project\">Manhattan Project<\/a>, and for founding the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lawrence_Berkeley_Laboratory\" title=\"Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lawrence_Livermore_Laboratory\" title=\"Lawrence Livermore Laboratory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Lawrence Livermore Laboratory<\/a>.<\/p><p>A graduate of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_South_Dakota\" title=\"University of South Dakota\">University of South Dakota<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Minnesota\" title=\"University of Minnesota\">University of Minnesota<\/a>, Lawrence completed his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctor_of_Philosophy\" title=\"Doctor of Philosophy\">Doctor of Philosophy<\/a> degree in physics at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale<\/a> in 1925. In 1928, he was hired as an associate professor of physics at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_California,_Berkeley\" title=\"University of California, Berkeley\">University of California<\/a>, becoming the youngest full professor there two years later. In its library one evening, Lawrence was intrigued by a diagram of an accelerator that produced <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Particle_physics\" title=\"Particle physics\">high-energy particles<\/a>. He contemplated how it could be made compact, and came up with an idea for a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electromagnet\" title=\"Electromagnet\">electromagnet<\/a>. The result was the first <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclotron\" title=\"Cyclotron\">cyclotron<\/a>. Lawrence went on to build a series of ever larger and more expensive cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director.<\/p><p>During <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a>, Lawrence developed electromagnetic <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotope_separation\" title=\"Isotope separation\">isotope separation<\/a> at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Calutron\" title=\"Calutron\">calutrons<\/a>, a hybrid of the standard laboratory <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_spectrometer\" title=\"Mass spectrometer\" class=\"mw-redirect\">mass spectrometer<\/a> and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee\" title=\"Oak Ridge, Tennessee\">Oak Ridge, Tennessee<\/a>, which came to be called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Y-12_National_Security_Complex\" title=\"Y-12 National Security Complex\">Y-12<\/a>. The process was inefficient, but it worked.<\/p><p>After the war, Lawrence campaigned extensively for government sponsorship of large scientific programs, and was a forceful advocate of \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_Science\" title=\"Big Science\">Big Science<\/a>\", with its requirements for big machines and big money. Lawrence strongly backed <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edward_Teller\" title=\"Edward Teller\">Edward Teller<\/a>'s campaign for a second nuclear weapons laboratory, which Lawrence located in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Livermore,_California\" title=\"Livermore, California\">Livermore, California<\/a>.
