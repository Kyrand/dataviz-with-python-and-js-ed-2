Fenn shared half of the award with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Koichi_Tanaka\" title=\"Koichi Tanaka\">Koichi Tanaka<\/a> for their work in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_spectrometry\" title=\"Mass spectrometry\">mass spectrometry<\/a>. The other half of the 2002 award went to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kurt_W%C3%BCthrich\" title=\"Kurt W\u00fcthrich\">Kurt W\u00fcthrich<\/a>. Fenn's contributions specifically related to the development of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electrospray_ionization\" title=\"Electrospray ionization\">electrospray ionization<\/a>, now a commonly used technique for large molecules and routine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Early in his career, Fenn did research in the field of jet propulsion at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_SQUID\" title=\"Project SQUID\">Project SQUID<\/a>, and focused on <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Molecular_beam\" title=\"Molecular beam\">molecular beam<\/a> studies. Fenn finished his career with more than 100 publications, including one book.<\/p><p>Fenn was born in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City<\/a>, and moved to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kentucky\" title=\"Kentucky\">Kentucky<\/a> with his family during the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression<\/a>. Fenn did his undergraduate work at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Berea_College\" title=\"Berea College\">Berea College<\/a>, and received his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ph.D.\" title=\"Ph.D.\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Ph.D.<\/a> from Yale. He worked in industry at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monsanto\" title=\"Monsanto\">Monsanto<\/a> and at private research labs before moving to academic posts including Yale and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virginia_Commonwealth_University\" title=\"Virginia Commonwealth University\">Virginia Commonwealth University<\/a>.<\/p><p>Fenn's research into electrospray ionization found him at the center of a legal dispute with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale University<\/a>. He lost the lawsuit, after it was determined that he misled the university about the potential usefulness of the technology. Yale was awarded $500,000 in legal fees and $545,000 in damages. The decision pleased the university, but provoked mixed responses from some people affiliated with the institution, who were disappointed with the treatment of a Nobel Prize winner with such a long history at the school.<\/p>","name":"John Bennett Fenn","place_of_birth":"New York City ,  USA","place_of_death":"Richmond, Virginia ,  USA","text":"John Bennett Fenn , Chemistry, 2002","year":2002.0}
